<section id="what-is-rebalancing-why-do-we-care" class="level3">
<h3>What is rebalancing? Why do we care?</h3>
<p>Citi Bike faces a perpetual dillemma - how can they ensure there are
enough bikes in the right places to satisfy rider demand? Will the
natural flow of bikes from rider be enough?</p>
<p>Consider the flow of bikes through a popular commuter station on a
weekday:</p>
<figure>

alt="Commuter-Station-Bike-Flow" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Commuter-Station-Bike-Flow</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The blue line represents the cumulative change in quantity of bikes
at the station throughout the day. The gray and red lines represent the
typical and maximum high-volume dock station capacities
respectively.</p>
<p>Even if the station were to naturally start each day fully stocked,
the station would be depleted halfway through morning commuter hours
with significant remaining demand. Someone needs to bring in more bikes
so all riders can get to work - and conversely shuffle them away at the
end of the day…</p>
<p>Simply put, rebalancing is the manual movement of bikes from one
station to another to: - ensure there are sufficient bikes at each dock
station to satisfy predicted demand - ensure there is space at ending
dock station to receive incoming bikes - minimize number of
underutilized bikes sitting at unpopular locations</p>

<section id="how-does-citi-bike-rebalance" class="level3">
<h3>How does Citi Bike Rebalance?</h3>
<p>Citi Bike employs several methods to manage rebalancing needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Valet Service</em> - team members staff popular stations to
manage incoming and outgoing bikes, artificially elevating station
capacity and temporarily alleviating rush-hour problems</li>
<li><em>Bike Trains</em> - team members ride ebikes towing carriages of
12-16 bikes, ideal for rebalances in and around tight neghborhood
streets</li>
<li><em>Motorized Vehicles</em> - higher capacity vans operate 24/7 to
keep bikes moving to and from the most popular stations</li>
<li><em>Bike Angels</em> - Launched in 2018, this program grants Citi
Bike riders (non-employees) traveling along in-demand rebalance routes a
free trip and rewards points</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="identifying-rebalance-movements" class="level3">
<h3>Identifying Rebalance Movements</h3>
<p>The Citi Bike dataset does not contain information on individual bike
rebalances, nor is that generally available online except as aggregated
data in monthly reports. So how can someone tell when a bike was
rebalanced, and to where?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkE2EN9m5.jpg"
alt="Identifying-Rebalances" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Identifying-Rebalances</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The easiest method to do so is (for a given bike) compare the
starting station for each trip with the ending station of the previous
trip. If the bike appears to have teleported from one station to another
between trips, it most likely was rebalanced!</p>
</section>
<section id="general-rebalance-statistics" class="level3">
<h3>General Rebalance Statistics</h3>
<p>Predictably, the number of rebalance operations increases with number
of rides. The large drop after 2017 coincides with the introduction of
the Bike Angels program and clearly demonstrates how successful this
clever initiative is.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyMLHN9mc.jpg" width="350"
alt="Rides-vs-Rebalances" /> <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkctLE9Xc.png" width="350"
alt="Rides-per-year" /></p>
<p>For each year, almost every unique bike in service was rebalanced at
least once and almost every station was invovled in rebalancing
operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkDsi4qX5.jpg" width="350"
alt="rebalancing-unique-bikes" /> <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hycis4qm9.jpg" width="350"
alt="rebalancing-unique-stations" /></p>
<p>The vast majority of rides occurred in Manhattan, so it is not
suprising to see that is where most rebalance activity occurs. <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1OGFI9X9.png"
alt="Rebalance-By-Boro" /></p>
<p>It is important to note that bikes are rebalaced around and across
all Boros - confirming Citi Bike actively works to satisfy all rider
demand. <img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryYuFUc79.png"
alt="Log-Rebalance-By-Boro" /></p>
<p>Individual stations with the highest rebalanace activity are mostly
commuter stations. Many have both a high number of bikes moved to and
from them based on commuter demands as shown above. <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkEV6dhX9.png"
alt="Stations-Rebalance" /></p>
</section>
<section id="rebalance-routes" class="level3">
<h3>Rebalance Routes</h3>
<p>We can glean more information about rebalance operations if we look
not just at bikes moving to and from individual stations, but consider
pairwise movement between two stations.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJhBaLqXq.png"
alt="Rebalance-Routes" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Rebalance-Routes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not only is the majority of rebalance activity focused on a small
number of stations in Manhattan, most of it occurs between a small
number of station pairs. This makes sense in the context of commuter
bike flow, where there is a need for a constant flow of bikes away from
destination stations to origin stations to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>Notice that some of the top routes are just the reverse direction of
others. Visualizing bi-directional flow between station pairs further
emphasizes how critical rebalance operations are between a small number
of station pairs.</p>
<figure>

alt="Bi-Directional-Rebalance-Routes" />

</figure>
<p>It should be noted that rebalance operations are probably more
nuanced then bikes being moved along static ‘routes’ - it’s very
possible a van will stop at several stations along a circuit - but this
aggregate analysis still helps us understand how much effort and expense
is required to support the highest volume stations.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most intersting way to look at station related rebalance
data is visualized on a map - check out our dash app to see this for
2019!</p>

<section id="rebalance-timing" class="level3">
<h3>Rebalance Timing</h3>
<p>We don’t know precisely when a bike was rebalanced, only when a trip
started after the bike was rebalanced These time estimates (in hours)
all reflect the maximum time a rebalance operation could take. We can
conclusively say a good part of Citi Bike rebalancing is done to
alleviate immediate demand, such as during commutes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1La58cX9.png" width="350"
alt="Rebalance-Timing" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Rebalance-Timing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Again, it appears that the Bike Angels program and Valet Service had
profound impacts on the need for immediate rebalances. <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyWzoL5X9.png"
alt="Rebalance-Timing-YearFacet" /></p>
<p>It appears that there are different reblance strategies used for
popular stations. Some seem to have the majority of rebalances done
overnight while others seem to be more frequently rebalanced for
immediate use. Both modes are necessary to keep up with demand. <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ZQaKh75.png"
alt="Rebalance-Timing-Stations" /></p>
<p>Investigating timing for rebalance routes provides deeper insight,
where we can see some routes are used to stock stations overnight for
the next day’s commute and others are used to satisfy immediate demand.

</section>
<section id="seasonality" class="level3">
<h3>Seasonality</h3>
<p>As expected, rebalance activity tracks with ridership where most of
the activity occurs in the summer months. The Bike Angel program
launched in 2018 had a profound effect on flattening this trend compared
to previous years.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkoCY8cmc.png"
alt="Annual-Rebalance-Season" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Annual-Rebalance-Season</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Similarly, post Bike Angel rebalance activity tracks with ridership
where most acitivity occurs during the week supporting commuters. <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkqX585Xq.png"
alt="Weekly-Rebalance-Season" /></p>
</section>
<section id="bikers-dislike-going-uphill" class="level3">
<h3>Bikers Dislike Going Uphill</h3>
<p>In aggregate more bikes were rebalanced from lower elevation stations
than to, and more bikes were rebalanced to higher elevation stations
than from. This suggests bikers who ride downhill often find other modes
of transport for return trips.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1KB3N5Xc.jpg" width="350"
alt="rebalance-elevation-bins" /> <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By422Vqm9.png" width="350"
alt="rebalance-elevation-density" /></p>
<p>This becomes even more apparent when looking at a density plot of
years pre and post launch of the Bike Angel program. In 2016, the
difference between station elevations for rebalance movements is
somewhat normally distributed. In 2019, there is a long right tail
indicating significantly more bikes are rebalanced to higher elevations
- even the Bike Angels aren’t willing to climb hills.</p>

<section id="future-analysis" class="level3">
<h3>Future Analysis?</h3>
<p>There are nearly endless ways to dive into ridership and rebalance
data to understand needs and motivations of bikeshare participants or
the general movement of individuals around New York. This analysis
focused mostly on data aggregated over the years available (2014-2000)
which helps us interpret rebalance operations as a whole. Future work
could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on a specific year, season, or days to understand and
predict usage and rebalance needs with respect to changes in overall
ridership and events such as holidays and professional sports games</li>
<li>Comparing rides and rebalance statistics across years as docking
stations are introduced, moved, or retired to evaluate past decisions
and inform future strategy/goals</li>
<li>Developing a predictive model to inform Citi Bike if a dock stations
is on track to be depleted or filled and needs immediate rebalancing
outside of normally scheduled operations, and if or how it may be
influenced by external factors such as weather</li>
</ul>
