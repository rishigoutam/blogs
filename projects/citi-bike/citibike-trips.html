<h1>Predicting Citi Bike Trip Demand</h1>
<p>In this article, we show how we analyzed the Citi Bike dataset and
built a model to predict ridership based on seasonality and weather.</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Citi Bike opened in New York City in 2013<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Citi Bike operates in multiple areas and has been
active for several years. We focused our analysis on the primary NYC
boroughs Citi Bike operates in (Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens). Unless
otherwise specified, statistics and graphics in this article are for the
year 2019 and these boroughs <img
src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1hC_xnX9.png" /><br />
<br />
</span></span> and has since grown in ridership, bikes, and bike dock
stations. Predicting demand for bikes is important for Motivate, Citi
Bike’s parent company, in order to both reduce operating costs and
increase ridership. Costs are incurred by having under-utilized bikes on
the streets by wear-and-tear on bikes due to exposure to the elements or
other forms of damage, so it is necessary to warehouse bikes if they are
not serving riders. However, having too few a number of bikes available
leads to a poor customer experience and loss of revenue due to
dissatisfied customers.</p>
<p>We aim to first understand what features drive demand and then to
create a predictive model. Finally, we compare our model against the
actual number of trips to evaluate its usefulness.</p>
</section>
<section id="analyzing-the-data" class="level2">
<h2>Analyzing the data</h2>
<p>We focused our exploratory data analysis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rider demographics</li>
<li>Citi Bike’s growth and resilience in the face of COVID-19</li>
<li>Time (Seasonality)</li>
<li>Weather</li>
</ul>
<p>And determined that time and some weather conditions would make for
good predictors for a time-series model. Here is that analysis.</p>
<section id="demographics" class="level3">
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>By age, most riders are between 20 and 40 years and are mostly male.
Citi Bike has two classes of riders–annual subscribers and single-ride
or day pass purchasers. We see a default age of 50 years for riders
purchasing one-off trips or passes in the chart below.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkmjbY2Q5.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJlaRG0Xq.png" /></p>
<p>We can see the gender and customer type distribution through the
much-maligned pie chart</p>

<section id="growth-and-resilience-of-citi-bike" class="level3">
<h3>Growth and Resilience of Citi Bike</h3>
<p>As the number of Citi Bike trips grows, operational efficiency is
more important to company finances. In addition, there is need for
accurately predicting demand and rebalancing stations effectively</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkAj_YnXq.png" /></p>
<p>Bike stations appear to expand along subway lines…potential for
further expansion into Brooklyn, the Bronx, or Queens?</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJXDFY3mq.png" /></p>
<p>While Citi Bike is not used as much as mass transit in NYC, it
offered a way for city residents to move from A to B during the pandemic
that wasn’t in an enclosed space…perhaps this is why it didn’t see as
sharp a drop in demand compared to the NYC subway or buses</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkI3YYn7c.png" /></p>
</section>
<section id="temporal-analysis" class="level3">
<h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>
<p>We see increased usage in the summer as one might expect, but not all
summer days prove to have high counts.</p>
<p>Labor Day 2019 shows reduced demand…and weather might also play an
effect. We examine that later.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkpMqK2m9.png"
width="350" /><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Rs9tn7c.png"
width="350" /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, weekends, especially Sunday, seem to have lower trip
counts on average than weekday. Sunday truly is the day of rest.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJodoYnXc.png"
width="350" /><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJIV2jhQ5.png"
width="350" /></p>
<p>Looks like commuters make up a bulk of trips given the high trip
counts around 8am and 5pm. This also explains the reduced number of
trips on weekends.</p>
</section>
<section id="weather" class="level3">
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>We began by looking at daily average temperature and found that trip
demand is highly correlated with it. We can use this as a model
predictor!</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJcchi2Qc.png" /></p>
<p>We wanted to investigate whether weather conditions might have an
effect on number of trips…however, only saw decrease for days with
precipitation (rain/snow)</p>
<p>Conditions like fog (all types), thunder, or haze were low in terms
of number of days and did not have as strong an effect (although we were
surprised by the positive effect)</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByVAno379.png" /></p>
<p>Digging deeper into rain, we wanted to see if the amount of rain
mattered…and it does! (as expected)</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByyeajnQc.png" /></p>
<p>Based on this analysis, we decided to create a model incorporating
time, average temperature, and amount of precipitation in order to
predict the number of trips.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="trip-demand-prediction-models" class="level2">
<h2>Trip Demand Prediction Models</h2>
<p>We attempted two models, the first of our models is the traditional
SARIMA model, the second was a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural
Network (LSTM-RNN). In this, we further distinguish the models by the
time resolution, and whether or not the model was including weather data
(i.e. had multidimensional inputs). Notably absent from our treatment is
a vectorized SARIMA model or SVARIMA; however, this was due to time
considerations and the fact that LSTM-RNN models on average demonstrate
far better performance on multidimensional time series than traditional
models and approaches.</p>
<p>The population data is found in in the seconds resolution; however,
at this resolution, observations are not continuously present and we
have long gaps for many seconds of the year with zero ridership. We take
a look at the hourly ridership data from 2019; whatever model we create
for one year we can easily generalize to multiple years.</p>
<p>As a preliminary assessment of the data, we look at the ridership
over the year along different timescales–in doing so we can begin to
understand trends and seasonality relationships within the day. Changing
the scale of our data, as we will see, is akin to passing the “wave” of
our time series through a low-pass filter, giving us lower frequency
relationships. Therefore, if there is high seasonality at low timescale,
this will be erased as we increase our timescale and aggregate over
larger steps.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk1BWhhm9.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Gsio3Qc.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJsb3ohQ5.png" /></p>
<p>We can see from the above graphs that weekly resolution is far too
sparse to capture meaningful relationships. Therefore, we would like to
build models that predict at the Hourly timescale if we can, and if not,
then use the Daily timescale</p>
<p>At the sub hourly timescale, the data became too unwieldy and noisy
for a years worth, let alone for the many years of data Citi Bike has
available. However in future extensions of this project we would like to
take a second level resolution for one week for one station and predict
the ridership at that level.</p>
<p>Our models were thus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Daily SARIMA, which did not converge to parameters.</li>
<li>Daily LSTM-RNN with weather, which had reduced RMS error.</li>
<li>Hourly LSTM-RNN without weather, which had great success.</li>
</ol>
<p>We compared these models by producing the Daily and Hourly RMSE and
comparing them to find the RMSE minimizing model.</p>
<p>Based on our results, we would believe that an hourly LSTM-RNN for a
specific station, with weather, will be the best model, and this is the
model we will investigate for further research. However, we found that
including the weather data, while good at predicting trends in average
ridership, is not as good at predicting the noise, which is only
captured at the hourly level.</p>

<p>Above is the two week prediction for the two week ridership given the
entire years worth of data. The line is our median prediction and the
light blue section is the 85% confidence interval. We see that our
prediction model has a SSE of 53381920877, giving us a RMSE of 231045.27
rides/day, 9626.88 rides/hour. This is our number to beat.</p>

<h3>Long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM)</h3>
<p><strong>Intro to RNN and LSTM-RNN</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>RNN</dt>
<dd>
<em>Recurrent Neural Network</em>: This is a type of Artificial Neural
Network that can also update all of its weights through time. RNN’s are
extremely powerful techniques that can allow for short-term memory to be
introduced into the model.
</dd>
<dt>LSTM</dt>
<dd>
<em>Long Short Term Memory</em>: This is an extension of RNN’s that
allow those RNN’s to have long term memory and short term memory. While
powerful, RNNs suffer from the drawback that, after too many time steps,
the earliest information is almost entirely forgotten. Relevant
information is essential to
</dd>
<dt>Cross-validation</dt>
<dd>
This is a technique where the dataset is split into not only training
and testing, but the whole training set is split into batches and then
split into into testing and validation sets. This is almost always done
randomly, which proves to be effective when dealing with most data, as
sampling biases are attenuated. However, with time series, randomly
sampling the data is going to ruin the relationship with time that we
are trying to predict.
</dd>
<dt>Backtesting</dt>
<dd>
Backtesting is Crossvalidation for Time Series models. Instead of
randomly sorting the data into different batches, we take each batch of
the data without disrupting the time series. Below is our Daily
backtesting strategy.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Daily LSTM-RNN (with Weather) Backtesting
Strategy</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJGjSP0m9.png" /></p>
<p>Above we see the backtesting split and the train test split for each
backtest slice. We can see the progression of each of the splits through
the year. Zooming into each split, we have:</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BymbLDCQc.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Daily LSTM-RNN (with Weather) Predictions</strong></p>
<p>First, let us take a look at how the Temperature and Average
Precipitation data influences the ridership number. Below we see the
Ridership, Average Temperature, and Average Rainfall over the entire
year of 2019.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyDgtw0mc.png" /></p>
<p>Zooming into the January, we can see that there is clear monthly, and
weekly seasonality. Furthermore, there seems to be a direct correlation
between average temperature and ridership, and an inverse correlation
between precipitation and ridership.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HysYKvAXq.png" /></p>
<p>We can see the predictions over each of the backtesting slices to get
an idea of how our model looks like after training, and without
early-stopping to correct for overfitting. Below, we see each slice with
their prediction, and each RMSE value.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1kddDCXc.png" /></p>
<p>While these predictions don’t look particularly impressive against
our data, keep in mind that a lot of the jaggedness of the data comes
from the fact that total ridership can jump drastically between days for
a number of factors. The mean RMSE was 15197 bikes/day +/- 6097
bikes/day as the standard deviation. This gives us a hourly RMSE of
633.21 bikes/hour on average. Thus, moving to an LSTM model with weather
drastically improved our daily RMSE, and this is a significant enough
improvement to warrant exploring the LSTM approach further.</p>
<p><strong>Hourly LSTM-RNN Backtesting Strategy (without Weather) and
Predictions</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJtZhDA75.png" /></p>
<p>Going down to the hourly timescale, without including the weather
data, we have already seen that the full years worth of data is
extremely noisy. Looking at our backtesting strategy, we can see that
reflected. Zooming into each month, we can see that there is a sub-daily
seasonality to the data that we have been unable to capture.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1pJsuAQc.png" /></p>
<p>Fitting an LSTM model to these, we reach the following backtesting
predictions.</p>
<p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkRmPVJVc.png" /></p>
<p>We have an average RMSE of 1117.191 rides/hour, giving us a daily
RMSE of 26812.58 rides/day. We can see that these models look much more
predictive of the oscillations in the data; however, we also note that
the calculated the daily and hourly errors naively and the resolution of
the prediction we get is much stronger in the hourly timescale.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Our exploratory data analysis informed our model feature selection
and we attempted two time-series models (SARIMA and LSTM) to predict
trip demand on both an hourly and daily basis. We found that hourly
models were better overall. Further improvements to the model would be
in reducing the root mean square error in predictions and, perhaps,
incorporating additional predictors. For future work, we would like to
build an LSTM model for each station on the hourly timescale accounting
for weather. From our study, we believe that this would give us the
strongest predictive accuracy for our model.</p>
<p>Separately, we analyzed bike rebalancing. You can read the full
